### Senior DevOps Engineer & Cloud Solutions Architect

My passion for the engineering world began when I was just a kid 👼🏼 playing videogames 🎮 and dreaming about all the beautiful things that science 🗜️ and dedication 💪 could create. 
Now, after years of education and hard work 📕, I got the knowledge of several software engineering principles essential for product design 🥇, paying special attention to detail when writing clean and efficient code that aligns with industry best practices 🖥️, ensuring not only functionality but also ease of maintenance 🚀.
